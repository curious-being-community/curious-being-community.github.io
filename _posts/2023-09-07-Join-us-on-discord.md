If you're here, there's a chance you've attended one of our events - either in person or online.

The main way our community stays in contact is through Discord. It's a versatile, safe, and free platform that allows us to video call, chat, and connect easily.

If you want to be alerted about new events, this is the way to do that.

Here's one of our members, Anya, explaining why we use it in about 150 seconds:
